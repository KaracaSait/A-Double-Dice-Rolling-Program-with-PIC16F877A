# A-Double-Dice-Rolling-Program-with-PIC16F877A

After connecting the PIC16F877A microcontroller, LCD screen, and keypad in the Proteus circuit, different operations were programmed to respond to different buttons. This allowed the programmed content to be displayed on the LCD screen.

Programmed Contents:

Button 1: Selects a random number from the pool of numbers between 1-6, generated by the rng code block we wrote in C language, and writes it on the first line of the LCD screen.

Button 2: Selects a random number from the pool of numbers between 1-6, generated by the rng code block we wrote in C language, and writes it on the first line of the LCD screen.

Button 3: Selects two random numbers from the pool of numbers between 1-6, generated by the rng code block for the 1st and 2nd dice we wrote in C language, and writes them on both lines of the LCD screen.

Button 4: Clears the LCD screen.

Button 5: Writes "Micro Lab Final" on the first line and "Project" on the second line of the LCD screen.

Button *: Writes the name and surname of the 1st student on the first line of the LCD screen and writes their school number on the second line.

Button #: Writes the name and surname of the 2nd student on the first line of the LCD screen and writes their school number on the second line.
